      <p><b>Mapping IPV4 Addresses using Hilbert Curves</b></p>
    	<p>Click to see hilbert curve embeded on map.</p>

    	<p>This renders a hilbert curve with a color gradient showing how many systems are online.</p>
 	<p>Hilbert curve and its discrete approximations are useful because they give a mapping between 1D and 2D space that preserves.</p>
 	<p>This means that two data points which are close to each other in one-dimensional space.</p>
	<p>The range of IP addresses used by computers can be mapped into a picture using the Hilbert curve.</p>
	<p>Code to generate the image would map from 2D to 1D to find the color of each pixel.</p>
	<p>The Hilbert curve is sometimes used because it keeps nearby IP addresses close to each other in the picture.</p>
