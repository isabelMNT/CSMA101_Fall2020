      <p><b>Mapping IPV4 Addresses using Hilbert Curves</b></p>
    	<p>Click to see hilbert curve embeded on map.</p>

    	<p>Hilbert curve is a type of space-filling curves that folds one dimensional axis into a two dimensional space.</p>
	<p>But still keeps the locality. It has advantages to visualize data with long axise.</p>
	<p>The length of the curve becomes longer and the curve folds more densely.</p>
	<p>Hilbert curve folds one-dimensional axis into a two-dimensional space while still preserves the locality of the data points.</p>
	<p>The HilbertCurve package provides a rather simple way to display the data in the form of Hilbert curve.</p>
	<p>It hides all the technical parts and users only need to think that they are adding graphics on a novel axis based on specifying positions.</p>

	<p>This renders a hilbert curve with a color gradient showing how many systems are online.</p>
	<p>The range of IP addresses used by computers can be mapped into a picture using the Hilbert curve.</p>
	<p>The code generates the image that would map from 2D to 1D and finds the color of each pixel.</p>
	<p>The Hilbert curve is sometimes used because it keeps nearby IP addresses close to each other in the picture.</p>
	<p>The map can be overlayed to the Hilbert curve for easy correspondance.</p>
