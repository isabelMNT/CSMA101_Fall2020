      <p><b>Mapping IPV4 Addresses using Hilbert Curves</b></p>
    	<p>This renders a hilbert curve with a color gradient showing how many systems are online.</p>
 	<p> Hilbert curve and its discrete approximations are useful because they give a mapping between 1D and 2D space that preserves. This means that two data points which are close to each other in one-dimensional space.</p>
	<p> the range of IP addresses used by computers can be mapped into a picture using the Hilbert curve. Code to generate the image would map from 2D to 1D to find the color of each pixel, and the Hilbert curve is sometimes used because it keeps nearby IP addresses close to each other in the picture.</p>
